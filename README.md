Learning objectives:

- Explain basic HPC concepts
- Profile and benchmark R code
- Develop parallel R code
- Identify HPC-oriented R packages
- Use R on CARC systems

Example job scripts:

- [serial.job](job-scripts/serial.job)
- [multicore.job](job-scripts/multicore.job)
- [mpi.job](job-scripts/mpi.job)
- [array.job](job-scripts/array.job)
- [launcher.job](job-scripts/launcher.job)
